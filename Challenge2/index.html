            <h2>Why we use the Normalize CSS Script</h2>
            <p>We use Normalize CSS Script to help establish a sense of normalcy accross browsers. 
                Each browser typically has a different way that they work so normalize helps to set a baseline 
                no matter which browser the user is in which helps to make sure the design and other elements 
                don't get messed up.

            <h2>What is Semantic Markup</h2>
            <p>Semantic markup helps to properly section out websites. This helps with organization and also 
                adaptability. Furthermore, another webstie developer will also have an easier time looking at
                code with semantic markup because it follows the same kind of styles and regulations. Finally, 
                semantic markup helps search engines like google better find your website and later on can help with
                SEO.
